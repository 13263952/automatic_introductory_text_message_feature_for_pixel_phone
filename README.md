# Automatic Introductory Text Message Feature for Pixel Phone

Welcome to my project repository showcasing an intuitive process for the Pixel Phone, allowing users to send automatic introductory text messages at specific times of the day. This feature enhances user experience by simplifying the process of adding new contacts and sending introduction messages.

## Idea Overview

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of adding new contacts and sending introductory text messages. The proposed feature aims to provide users with a seamless experience by automating the following steps:

1. **Adding a New Contact:** Users can effortlessly add a new contact to their Pixel Phone's address book.

2. **Sending an Introductory Text Message:** After adding the contact, users can conveniently send an introductory text message with pre-written content. This eliminates the need to manually type out a message each time.

## User Process 

### Screen 1: Adding a New Contact

In this final screen, users can observe the pre-populated introductory text message, ready to be sent to the newly added contact.

This feature will allow users to mingle and be able to focus on the personal interactions at hand, it will also prevent the opportunity to mistype a text message late in the day after the user's senses might be fatigued or altered.
